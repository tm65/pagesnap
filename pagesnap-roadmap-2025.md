## Phase 1: Core Feature Parity (Months 1-3)
*August 2025 - October 2025*

### Overview
This phase focuses on closing critical feature gaps with commercial competitors while establishing PageSnap as a viable alternative for developers who need screenshot capabilities.

### 1.1 Essential Features

#### **PDF Generation Using Playwright**
**What it does**: Converts web pages to PDF format with customizable options for page size, margins, headers/footers, and orientation.

**Rationale**:
- 40% of screenshot API use cases involve PDF generation (invoices, reports, archives)
- Playwright already supports this natively, making implementation straightforward
- Critical for enterprise document workflows

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Example configuration
{
  "format": "pdf",
  "pdfOptions": {
    "format": "A4",
    "printBackground": true,
    "margin": { "top": "1cm", "bottom": "1cm" },
    "headerTemplate": "<span class='title'></span>",
    "footerTemplate": "<span class='pageNumber'></span>"
  }
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- PDF generation working for 95% of test sites
- Support for all standard page formats
- Custom header/footer implementation
- File size optimization (< 5MB for standard pages)

---

#### **HTML-to-Screenshot Functionality**
