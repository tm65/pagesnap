# PageSnap as a Scalable Screenshot Solution

This document provides an analysis of the supported and proposed output formats for PageSnap, evaluating their suitability for use in a scalable, high-volume screenshot service.

---

### Core Principles of a Scalable Solution

A scalable screenshot solution must balance three competing factors:
1.  **Fidelity:** How accurately the output represents the visual appearance of the live webpage.
2.  **File Size:** The storage and bandwidth costs associated with each screenshot.
3.  **Utility:** The usefulness of the output format for the end user's goal (e.g., visual review, content analysis, archival).

### Analysis of Output Formats

#### PNG (Portable Network Graphics)

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Lossless & High-Fidelity:** PNG uses lossless compression, guaranteeing a pixel-perfect, high-fidelity representation of the rendered page. This is critical for UI/UX review, design validation, and legal archival where accuracy is paramount.
    *   **Transparency Support:** Fully supports alpha channels, allowing for screenshots with transparent backgrounds if needed.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Larger File Sizes:** For visually complex pages (especially those with photographic elements), PNG files can be significantly larger than their JPG counterparts, leading to higher storage and bandwidth costs at scale.

*   **Verdict:** **The best default choice.** Its guarantee of visual accuracy makes it the most reliable format for a general-purpose screenshot tool.

#### JPG/JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Excellent Compression:** Offers superior compression for photographic and complex images, resulting in very small file sizes. This directly translates to lower storage and bandwidth costs.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Lossy Compression:** JPG is a lossy format. This will introduce visual artifacts, particularly around sharp edges, lines, and text. It is not pixel-perfect and is unsuitable for use cases requiring high fidelity.
    *   **No Transparency:** Does not support transparent backgrounds.

*   **Verdict:** **A valuable alternative for cost savings.** Should be offered as a "high compression" option where a slight loss of quality is an acceptable trade-off for reduced file size.

#### SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Infinitely Scalable:** As a vector format, it can be scaled to any size without loss of quality.
    *   **Searchable & Selectable Content:** Text within the SVG remains text, allowing it to be searched, copied, and indexed.
    *   **Potentially Small File Size:** For pages that are primarily text and simple shapes, the file size can be very small.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Not a True Screenshot:** An SVG export represents the page's Document Object Model (DOM), not its final rendered pixels. It cannot capture non-DOM content like `<canvas>` drawings or WebGL renderings.
    *   **Rendering Unreliability:** SVGs often link to external resources like CSS, fonts, and images. If these resources are not publicly available or the SVG is viewed offline, it will render incorrectly. Making it self-contained is a complex and often fragile process.

*   **Verdict:** **A potential enhancement, not a core feature.** SVG output should be positioned as a specialized "content export" or "DOM archive" feature for analysis, not as a reliable visual screenshot format. Its unreliability makes it unsuitable as a primary screenshot option.
